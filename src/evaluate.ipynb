True\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  False\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  The claim is true. In 2011, the National Labor Relations Board, under the Obama administration, did file a complaint against Boeing for opening a new plant in South Carolina, alleging that the decision was retaliatory against union workers in Washington state.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  After multiple attempts to find evidence related to the claim that President Obama and the National Labor Relations Board sued Boeing over its decision to open a plant in South Carolina, no relevant information was found. Therefore, based on the lack of evidence supporting the claim, the statement is deemed false.\n","\n","CLAIM:  Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on an assault weapons ban.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  True\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  True\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  False\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  Mitt Romney has changed his stance on the assault weapons ban multiple times throughout his political career, leading to accusations of flip-flopping on the issue.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  Despite searching for specific details on Mitt Romney's stance on an assault weapons ban, I could not find conclusive evidence to support the claim that he flip-flopped on this issue. Therefore, I have determined the claim to be false.\n","\n","CLAIM:  To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine. Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  True\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  True\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  False\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  The claim accurately states that there are 400,000 unemployed individuals in New Jersey, one of the worst jobless rates in the country, and that working and middle-class families have seen costs rise, including property taxes and college tuition.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  The evidence retrieved did not provide specific information to support the claim about 400,000 unemployed individuals, one of the worst jobless rates in the country, and soaring costs for working and middle-class families in New Jersey.\n","\n","CLAIM:  We know there are more Democrats in Georgia than Republicans. We know that for a fact.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  False\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  False\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  True\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  Without specific data or evidence to support the claim, it cannot be definitively stated as a fact.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  The evidence suggests that there is a notable Democratic presence in Georgia, with Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff and the participation in the 2024 presidential election being indicators of this.\n","\n","CLAIM:  A voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  True\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  True\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  False\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  The claim states that the voucher school collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening, which is a verifiable fact. The fact that the school closed after only 9 days this year does not change the truthfulness of the claim.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  Based on the lack of specific evidence related to the claim, it is unlikely that a voucher school collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies after closing just 9 days after opening.\n","\n","CLAIM:  Says his state budget will provide an increase in state funding for the 2011-12 school year.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  True\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  True\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  False\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  The claim states that the state budget will provide an increase in state funding for the 2011-12 school year. This can be verified by looking at the specific details of the state budget for that year.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  Despite searching for specific information related to the claim about state funding for the 2011-12 school year in California, the evidence retrieved did not provide any direct information supporting the claim. Therefore, based on the lack of evidence, the claim is deemed false.\n","\n","CLAIM:  Eighty percent of the American people support an approach (to federal budget problems) that includes revenues and includes cuts.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  True\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  True\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  False\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  This claim is supported by various polls and surveys conducted on the topic of federal budget problems and the American people's preferences for addressing them.\n","TOOL JUSTIFICATION:  Despite searching for specific survey results related to American people's support for a budget approach that includes revenues and cuts, no direct evidence was found to support the claim. Therefore, based on the lack of specific data, the claim cannot be verified as true.\n","\n","CLAIM:  A salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception is not going to get that service through her employers health care plan because her employer doesnt think she should be using contraception.\n","GROUND TRUTH:  False\n","BASELINE PREDICTION:  False\n","TOOL PREDICTION:  True\n","BASELINE JUSTIFICATION:  The claim is false because in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations like Hobby Lobby could be exempt from providing certain forms of contraception coverage in their employee health plans based on religious beliefs. However, this does not mean that all employees at Hobby Lobby are unable to access contraception through their health care plan.
